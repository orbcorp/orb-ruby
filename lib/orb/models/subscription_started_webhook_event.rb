      # @!attribute subscription
      #   A [subscription](/core-concepts#subscription) represents the purchase of a plan
      #   by a customer.
      #
      #   By default, subscriptions begin on the day that they're created and renew
      #   automatically for each billing cycle at the cadence that's configured in the
      #   plan definition.
      #
      #   Subscriptions also default to **beginning of month alignment**, which means the
      #   first invoice issued for the subscription will have pro-rated charges between
      #   the `start_date` and the first of the following month. Subsequent billing
      #   periods will always start and end on a month boundary (e.g. subsequent month
      #   starts for monthly billing).
      #
      #   Depending on the plan configuration, any _flat_ recurring fees will be billed
      #   either at the beginning (in-advance) or end (in-arrears) of each billing cycle.
      #   Plans default to **in-advance billing**. Usage-based fees are billed in arrears
      #   as usage is accumulated. In the normal course of events, you can expect an
      #   invoice to contain usage-based charges for the previous period, and a recurring
      #   fee for the following period.
