    class Subscriptions
      # Some parameter documentations has been truncated, see
      # {Orb::Models::SubscriptionCreateParams} for more details.
      #
      # A subscription represents the purchase of a plan by a customer. The customer is
      # identified by either the `customer_id` or the `external_customer_id`, and
      # exactly one of these fields must be provided.
      #
      # By default, subscriptions begin on the day that they're created and renew
      # automatically for each billing cycle at the cadence that's configured in the
      # plan definition.
      #
      # The default configuration for subscriptions in Orb is **In-advance billing** and
      # **Beginning of month alignment** (see
      # [Subscription](/core-concepts##subscription) for more details).
      #
      # In order to change the alignment behavior, Orb also supports billing
      # subscriptions on the day of the month they are created. If
      # `align_billing_with_subscription_start_date = true` is specified, subscriptions
      # have billing cycles that are aligned with their `start_date`. For example, a
      # subscription that begins on January 15th will have a billing cycle from January
      # 15th to February 15th. Every subsequent billing cycle will continue to start and
      # invoice on the 15th.
      #
      # If the "day" value is greater than the number of days in the month, the next
      # billing cycle will start at the end of the month. For example, if the start_date
      # is January 31st, the next billing cycle will start on February 28th.
      #
      # If a customer was created with a currency, Orb only allows subscribing the
      # customer to a plan with a matching `invoicing_currency`. If the customer does
      # not have a currency set, on subscription creation, we set the customer's
      # currency to be the `invoicing_currency` of the plan.
      #
      # ## Customize your customer's subscriptions
      #
      # Prices and adjustments in a plan can be added, removed, or replaced for the
      # subscription being created. This is useful when a customer has prices that
      # differ from the default prices for a specific plan.
      #
      # <Note>
      # This feature is only available for accounts that have migrated to Subscription Overrides Version 2. You can find your
      # Subscription Overrides Version at the bottom of your [Plans page](https://app.withorb.com/plans)
      # </Note>
      #
      # ### Adding Prices
      #
      # To add prices, provide a list of objects with the key `add_prices`. An object in
      # the list must specify an existing add-on price with a `price_id` or
      # `external_price_id` field, or create a new add-on price by including an object
      # with the key `price`, identical to what would be used in the request body for
      # the [create price endpoint](/api-reference/price/create-price). See the
      # [Price resource](/product-catalog/price-configuration) for the specification of
      # different price model configurations possible in this object.
      #
      # If the plan has phases, each object in the list must include a number with
      # `plan_phase_order` key to indicate which phase the price should be added to.
      #
      # An object in the list can specify an optional `start_date` and optional
      # `end_date`. This is equivalent to creating a price interval with the
      # [add/edit price intervals endpoint](/api-reference/price-interval/add-or-edit-price-intervals).
      # If unspecified, the start or end date of the phase or subscription will be used.
      #
      # An object in the list can specify an optional `minimum_amount`,
      # `maximum_amount`, or `discounts`. This will create adjustments which apply only
      # to this price.
      #
      # Additionally, an object in the list can specify an optional `reference_id`. This
      # ID can be used to reference this price when
      # [adding an adjustment](#adding-adjustments) in the same API call. However the ID
      # is _transient_ and cannot be used to refer to the price in future API calls.
      #
      # ### Removing Prices
      #
      # To remove prices, provide a list of objects with the key `remove_prices`. An
      # object in the list must specify a plan price with either a `price_id` or
      # `external_price_id` field.
      #
      # ### Replacing Prices
      #
      # To replace prices, provide a list of objects with the key `replace_prices`. An
      # object in the list must specify a plan price to replace with the
      # `replaces_price_id` key, and it must specify a price to replace it with by
      # either referencing an existing add-on price with a `price_id` or
      # `external_price_id` field, or by creating a new add-on price by including an
      # object with the key `price`, identical to what would be used in the request body
      # for the [create price endpoint](/api-reference/price/create-price). See the
      # [Price resource](/product-catalog/price-configuration) for the specification of
      # different price model configurations possible in this object.
      #
      # For fixed fees, an object in the list can supply a `fixed_price_quantity`
      # instead of a `price`, `price_id`, or `external_price_id` field. This will update
      # only the quantity for the price, similar to the
      # [Update price quantity](/api-reference/subscription/update-price-quantity)
      # endpoint.
      #
      # The replacement price will have the same phase, if applicable, and the same
      # start and end dates as the price it replaces.
      #
      # An object in the list can specify an optional `minimum_amount`,
      # `maximum_amount`, or `discounts`. This will create adjustments which apply only
      # to this price.
      #
      # Additionally, an object in the list can specify an optional `reference_id`. This
      # ID can be used to reference the replacement price when
      # [adding an adjustment](#adding-adjustments) in the same API call. However the ID
      # is _transient_ and cannot be used to refer to the price in future API calls.
      #
      # ### Adding adjustments
      #
      # To add adjustments, provide a list of objects with the key `add_adjustments`. An
      # object in the list must include an object with the key `adjustment`, identical
      # to the adjustment object in the
      # [add/edit price intervals endpoint](/api-reference/price-interval/add-or-edit-price-intervals).
      #
      # If the plan has phases, each object in the list must include a number with
      # `plan_phase_order` key to indicate which phase the adjustment should be added
      # to.
      #
      # An object in the list can specify an optional `start_date` and optional
      # `end_date`. If unspecified, the start or end date of the phase or subscription
      # will be used.
      #
      # ### Removing adjustments
      #
      # To remove adjustments, provide a list of objects with the key
      # `remove_adjustments`. An object in the list must include a key, `adjustment_id`,
      # with the ID of the adjustment to be removed.
      #
      # ### Replacing adjustments
      #
      # To replace adjustments, provide a list of objects with the key
      # `replace_adjustments`. An object in the list must specify a plan adjustment to
      # replace with the `replaces_adjustment_id` key, and it must specify an adjustment
      # to replace it with by including an object with the key `adjustment`, identical
      # to the adjustment object in the
      # [add/edit price intervals endpoint](/api-reference/price-interval/add-or-edit-price-intervals).
      #
      # The replacement adjustment will have the same phase, if applicable, and the same
      # start and end dates as the adjustment it replaces.
      #
      # ## Price overrides (DEPRECATED)
      #
      # <Note>
      # Price overrides are being phased out in favor adding/removing/replacing prices. (See
      # [Customize your customer's subscriptions](/api-reference/subscription/create-subscription))
      # </Note>
      #
      # Price overrides are used to update some or all prices in a plan for the specific
      # subscription being created. This is useful when a new customer has negotiated a
      # rate that is unique to the customer.
      #
      # To override prices, provide a list of objects with the key `price_overrides`.
      # The price object in the list of overrides is expected to contain the existing
      # price id, the `model_type` and configuration. (See the
      # [Price resource](/product-catalog/price-configuration) for the specification of
      # different price model configurations.) The numerical values can be updated, but
      # the billable metric, cadence, type, and name of a price can not be overridden.
      #
      # ### Maximums and Minimums
      #
      # Minimums and maximums, much like price overrides, can be useful when a new
      # customer has negotiated a new or different minimum or maximum spend cap than the
      # default for a given price. If one exists for a price and null is provided for
      # the minimum/maximum override on creation, then there will be no minimum/maximum
      # on the new subscription. If no value is provided, then the default price maximum
      # or minimum is used.
      #
      # To add a minimum for a specific price, add `minimum_amount` to the specific
      # price in the `price_overrides` object.
      #
      # To add a maximum for a specific price, add `maximum_amount` to the specific
      # price in the `price_overrides` object.
      #
      # ### Minimum override example
      #
      # Price minimum override example:
      #
      # ```json
      # {
      #   ...
      #   "id": "price_id",
      #   "model_type": "unit",
      #   "unit_config": {
      #     "unit_amount": "0.50"
      #   },
      #   "minimum_amount": "100.00"
      #   ...
      # }
      # ```
      #
      # Removing an existing minimum example
      #
      # ```json
      # {
      #   ...
      #   "id": "price_id",
      #   "model_type": "unit",
      #   "unit_config": {
      #     "unit_amount": "0.50"
      #   },
      #   "minimum_amount": null
      #   ...
      # }
      # ```
      #
      # ### Discounts
      #
      # Discounts, like price overrides, can be useful when a new customer has
      # negotiated a new or different discount than the default for a price. If a
      # discount exists for a price and a null discount is provided on creation, then
      # there will be no discount on the new subscription.
      #
      # To add a discount for a specific price, add `discount` to the price in the
      # `price_overrides` object. Discount should be a dictionary of the format:
      #
      # ```ts
      # {
      #   "discount_type": "amount" | "percentage" | "usage",
      #   "amount_discount": string,
      #   "percentage_discount": string,
      #   "usage_discount": string
      # }
      # ```
      #
      # where either `amount_discount`, `percentage_discount`, or `usage_discount` is
      # provided.
      #
      # Price discount example
      #
      # ```json
      # {
      #   ...
      #   "id": "price_id",
      #   "model_type": "unit",
      #   "unit_config": {
      #     "unit_amount": "0.50"
      #   },
      #   "discount": {"discount_type": "amount", "amount_discount": "175"},
      # }
      # ```
      #
      # Removing an existing discount example
      #
      # ```json
      # {
      #   "customer_id": "customer_id",
      #   "plan_id": "plan_id",
      #   "discount": null,
      #   "price_overrides": [ ... ]
      #   ...
      # }
      # ```
      #
      # ## Threshold Billing
      #
      # Orb supports invoicing for a subscription when a preconfigured usage threshold
      # is hit. To enable threshold billing, pass in an `invoicing_threshold`, which is
      # specified in the subscription's invoicing currency, when creating a
      # subscription. E.g. pass in `10.00` to issue an invoice when usage amounts hit
      # \$10.00 for a subscription that invoices in USD.

      #
      # - `end_of_subscription_term`: stops the subscription from auto-renewing.
      #   Subscriptions that have been cancelled with this option can still incur
      #   charges for the remainder of their term:
      #
      #   - Issuing this cancellation request for a monthly subscription will keep the
      #     subscription active until the start of the subsequent month, and potentially
      #     issue an invoice for any usage charges incurred in the intervening period.
      #   - Issuing this cancellation request for a quarterly subscription will keep the
      #     subscription active until the end of the quarter and potentially issue an
      #     invoice for any usage charges incurred in the intervening period.
      #   - Issuing this cancellation request for a yearly subscription will keep the
      #     subscription active for the full year. For example, a yearly subscription
      #     starting on 2021-11-01 and cancelled on 2021-12-08 will remain active until
      #     2022-11-01 and potentially issue charges in the intervening months for any
      #     recurring monthly usage charges in its plan.
      #   - **Note**: If a subscription's plan contains prices with difference cadences,
      #     the end of term date will be determined by the largest cadence value. For
      #     example, cancelling end of term for a subscription with a quarterly fixed
      #     fee with a monthly usage fee will result in the subscription ending at the
      #     end of the quarter.
      #
      # - `immediate`: ends the subscription immediately, setting the `end_date` to the
      #   current time:
      #
      #   - Subscriptions that have been cancelled with this option will be invoiced
      #     immediately. This invoice will include any usage fees incurred in the
      #     billing period up to the cancellation, along with any prorated recurring
      #     fees for the billing period, if applicable.
      #   - **Note**: If the subscription has a recurring fee that was paid in-advance,
      #     the prorated amount for the remaining time period will be added to the
      #     [customer's balance](list-balance-transactions) upon immediate cancellation.
      #     However, if the customer is ineligible to use the customer balance, the
      #     subscription cannot be cancelled immediately.
      #
      # - `requested_date`: ends the subscription on a specified date, which requires a
      #   `cancellation_date` to be passed in. If no timezone is provided, the
      #   customer's timezone is used. For example, a subscription starting on January
      #   1st with a monthly price can be set to be cancelled on the first of any month
      #   after January 1st (e.g. March 1st, April 1st, May 1st). A subscription with
      #   multiple prices with different cadences defines the "term" to be the highest
      #   cadence of the prices.
      #
      # Upcoming subscriptions are only eligible for immediate cancellation, which will
      # set the `end_date` equal to the `start_date` upon cancellation.
      #
      # ## Backdated cancellations
      #
      # Orb allows you to cancel a subscription in the past as long as there are no paid
      # invoices between the `requested_date` and the current time. If the cancellation
      # is after the latest issued invoice, Orb will generate a balance refund for the
      # current period. If the cancellation is before the most recently issued invoice,
      # Orb will void the intervening invoice and generate a new one based on the new
      # dates for the subscription. See the section on

      # Some parameter documentations has been truncated, see

      #
      # This endpoint is used to fetch a subscription's usage in Orb. Especially when
      # combined with optional query parameters, this endpoint is a powerful way to
      # build visualizations on top of Orb's event data and metrics.
      #
      # With no query parameters specified, this endpoint returns usage for the
      # subscription's _current billing period_ across each billable metric that
      # participates in the subscription. Usage quantities returned are the result of
      # evaluating the metric definition for the entirety of the customer's billing
      # period.
      #
      # ### Default response shape
      #
      # Orb returns a `data` array with an object corresponding to each billable metric.
      # Nested within this object is a `usage` array which has a `quantity` value and a
      # corresponding `timeframe_start` and `timeframe_end`. The `quantity` value
      # represents the calculated usage value for the billable metric over the specified
      # timeframe (inclusive of the `timeframe_start` timestamp and exclusive of the
      # `timeframe_end` timestamp).
      #
      # Orb will include _every_ window in the response starting from the beginning of
      # the billing period, even when there were no events (and therefore no usage) in
      # the window. This increases the size of the response but prevents the caller from
      # filling in gaps and handling cumbersome time-based logic.
      #
      # The query parameters in this endpoint serve to override this behavior and
      # provide some key functionality, as listed below. Note that this functionality
      # can also be used _in conjunction_ with each other, e.g. to display grouped usage
      # on a custom timeframe.
      #
      # ## Custom timeframe
      #
      # In order to view usage for a custom timeframe rather than the current billing
      # period, specify a `timeframe_start` and `timeframe_end`. This will calculate
      # quantities for usage incurred between timeframe_start (inclusive) and
      # timeframe_end (exclusive), i.e. `[timeframe_start, timeframe_end)`.
      #
      # Note:
      #
      # - These timestamps must be specified in ISO 8601 format and UTC timezone, e.g.
      #   `2022-02-01T05:00:00Z`.
      # - Both parameters must be specified if either is specified.
      #
      # ## Grouping by custom attributes
      #
      # In order to view a single metric grouped by a specific _attribute_ that each
      # event is tagged with (e.g. `cluster`), you must additionally specify a
      # `billable_metric_id` and a `group_by` key. The `group_by` key denotes the event
      # property on which to group.
      #
      # When returning grouped usage, only usage for `billable_metric_id` is returned,
      # and a separate object in the `data` array is returned for each value of the
      # `group_by` key present in your events. The `quantity` value is the result of
      # evaluating the billable metric for events filtered to a single value of the
      # `group_by` key.
      #
      # Orb expects that events that match the billable metric will contain values in
      # the `properties` dictionary that correspond to the `group_by` key specified. By
      # default, Orb will not return a `null` group (i.e. events that match the metric
      # but do not have the key set). Currently, it is only possible to view usage
      # grouped by a single attribute at a time.
      #
      # When viewing grouped usage, Orb uses pagination to limit the response size to
      # 1000 groups by default. If there are more groups for a given subscription,
      # pagination metadata in the response can be used to fetch all of the data.
      #
      # The following example shows usage for an "API Requests" billable metric grouped
      # by `region`. Note the extra `metric_group` dictionary in the response, which
      # provides metadata about the group:
      #
      # ```json
      # {
      #     "data": [
      #         {
      #             "usage": [
      #                 {
      #                     "quantity": 0.19291,
      #                     "timeframe_start": "2021-10-01T07:00:00Z",
      #                     "timeframe_end": "2021-10-02T07:00:00Z",
      #                 },
      #                 ...
      #             ],
      #             "metric_group": {
      #                 "property_key": "region",
      #                 "property_value": "asia/pacific"
      #             },

      #                 "id": "Fe9pbpMk86xpwdGB",
      #                 "name": "API Requests"
      #             },
      #             "view_mode": "periodic"
      #         },
      #         ...
      #     ]
      # }
      # ```
      #
      # ## Windowed usage
      #
      # The `granularity` parameter can be used to _window_ the usage `quantity` value
      # into periods. When not specified, usage is returned for the entirety of the time
      # range.
      #
      # When `granularity = day` is specified with a timeframe longer than a day, Orb
      # will return a `quantity` value for each full day between `timeframe_start` and
      # `timeframe_end`. Note that the days are demarcated by the _customer's local
      # midnight_.
      #
      # For example, with `timeframe_start = 2022-02-01T05:00:00Z`,
      # `timeframe_end = 2022-02-04T01:00:00Z` and `granularity=day`, the following
      # windows will be returned for a customer in the `America/Los_Angeles` timezone
      # since local midnight is `08:00` UTC:
      #
      # - `[2022-02-01T05:00:00Z, 2022-02-01T08:00:00Z)`
      # - `[2022-02-01T08:00:00, 2022-02-02T08:00:00Z)`
      # - `[2022-02-02T08:00:00, 2022-02-03T08:00:00Z)`
      # - `[2022-02-03T08:00:00, 2022-02-04T01:00:00Z)`
      #

      #         ...
      #     ]
      # }
      # ```
      #
      # ## Decomposable vs. non-decomposable metrics
      #
      # Billable metrics fall into one of two categories: decomposable and
      # non-decomposable. A decomposable billable metric, such as a sum or a count, can
      # be displayed and aggregated across arbitrary timescales. On the other hand, a
      # non-decomposable metric is not meaningful when only a slice of the billing
      # window is considered.
      #
      # As an example, if we have a billable metric that's defined to count unique
      # users, displaying a graph of unique users for each day is not representative of
      # the billable metric value over the month (days could have an overlapping set of
      # 'unique' users). Instead, what's useful for any given day is the number of
      # unique users in the billing period so far, which are the _cumulative_ unique
      # users.
      #
      # Accordingly, this endpoint returns treats these two types of metrics differently
      # when `group_by` is specified:
      #
      # - Decomposable metrics can be grouped by any event property.
      # - Non-decomposable metrics can only be grouped by the corresponding price's
      #   invoice grouping key. If no invoice grouping key is present, the metric does
      #   not support `group_by`.
      #
      # ## Matrix prices
      #
      # When a billable metric is attached to a price that uses matrix pricing, it's
      # important to view usage grouped by those matrix dimensions. In this case, use
      # the query parameters `first_dimension_key`, `first_dimension_value` and
      # `second_dimension_key`, `second_dimension_value` while filtering to a specific
      # `billable_metric_id`.
      #
      # For example, if your compute metric has a separate unit price (i.e. a matrix
      # pricing model) per `region` and `provider`, your request might provide the
      # following parameters:
      #
      # - `first_dimension_key`: `region`
      # - `first_dimension_value`: `us-east-1`

      # Some parameter documentations has been truncated, see
      # {Orb::Models::SubscriptionPriceIntervalsParams} for more details.
      #
      # This endpoint is used to add and edit subscription
      # [price intervals](/api-reference/price-interval/add-or-edit-price-intervals). By
      # making modifications to a subscription’s price intervals, you can
      # [flexibly and atomically control the billing behavior of a subscription](/product-catalog/modifying-subscriptions).
      #
      # ## Adding price intervals
      #
      # Prices can be added as price intervals to a subscription by specifying them in
      # the `add` array. A `price_id` or `external_price_id` from an add-on price or
      # previously removed plan price can be specified to reuse an existing price
      # definition (however, please note that prices from other plans cannot be added to
      # the subscription). Additionally, a new price can be specified using the `price`
      # field — this price will be created automatically.
      #
      # A `start_date` must be specified for the price interval. This is the date when
      # the price will start billing on the subscription, so this will notably result in
      # an immediate charge at this time for any billed in advance fixed fees. The
      # `end_date` will default to null, resulting in a price interval that will bill on
      # a continually recurring basis. Both of these dates can be set in the past or the
      # future and Orb will generate or modify invoices to ensure the subscription’s
      # invoicing behavior is correct.
      #
      # Additionally, a discount, minimum, or maximum can be specified on the price
      # interval. This will only apply to this price interval, not any other price
      # intervals on the subscription.
      #
      # ## Adjustment intervals
      #
      # An adjustment interval represents the time period that a particular adjustment
      # (a discount, minimum, or maximum) applies to the prices on a subscription.
      # Adjustment intervals can be added to a subscription by specifying them in the
      # `add_adjustments` array, or modified via the `edit_adjustments` array. When
      # creating an adjustment interval, you'll need to provide the definition of the
      # new adjustment (the type of adjustment, and which prices it applies to), as well
      # as the start and end dates for the adjustment interval. The start and end dates
      # of an existing adjustment interval can be edited via the `edit_adjustments`
      # field (just like price intervals). (To "change" the amount of a discount,
      # minimum, or maximum, then, you'll need to end the existing interval, and create
      # a new adjustment interval with the new amount and a start date that matches the
      # end date of the previous interval.)
      #
      # ## Editing price intervals
      #
      # Price intervals can be adjusted by specifying edits to make in the `edit` array.
      # A `price_interval_id` to edit must be specified — this can be retrieved from the
      # `price_intervals` field on the subscription.
      #
      # A new `start_date` or `end_date` can be specified to change the range of the
      # price interval, which will modify past or future invoices to ensure correctness.
      # If either of these dates are unspecified, they will default to the existing date
      # on the price interval. To remove a price interval entirely from a subscription,
      # set the `end_date` to be equivalent to the `start_date`.
      #
      # ## Fixed fee quantity transitions
      #
      # The fixed fee quantity transitions for a fixed fee price interval can also be
      # specified when adding or editing by passing an array for
      # `fixed_fee_quantity_transitions`. A fixed fee quantity transition must have a
      # `quantity` and an `effective_date`, which is the date after which the new
      # quantity will be used for billing. If a fixed fee quantity transition is
      # scheduled at a billing period boundary, the full quantity will be billed on an
      # invoice with the other prices on the subscription. If the fixed fee quantity
      # transition is scheduled mid-billing period, the difference between the existing
      # quantity and quantity specified in the transition will be prorated for the rest
      # of the billing period and billed immediately, which will generate a new invoice.
      #
      # Notably, the list of fixed fee quantity transitions passed will overwrite the
      # existing fixed fee quantity transitions on the price interval, so the entire
      # list of transitions must be specified to add additional transitions. The
      # existing list of transitions can be retrieved using the
      # `fixed_fee_quantity_transitions` property on a subscription’s serialized price
      # intervals.

      #
      # This endpoint can be used to change an existing subscription's plan. It returns
      # the serialized updated subscription object.
      #
      # The body parameter `change_option` determines when the plan change occurrs. Orb
      # supports three options:
      #
      # - `end_of_subscription_term`: changes the plan at the end of the existing plan's
      #   term.
      #   - Issuing this plan change request for a monthly subscription will keep the
      #     existing plan active until the start of the subsequent month. Issuing this
      #     plan change request for a yearly subscription will keep the existing plan
      #     active for the full year. Charges incurred in the remaining period will be
      #     invoiced as normal.
      #   - Example: The plan is billed monthly on the 1st of the month, the request is
      #     made on January 15th, so the plan will be changed on February 1st, and
      #     invoice will be issued on February 1st for the last month of the original
      #     plan.
      # - `immediate`: changes the plan immediately.
      #   - Subscriptions that have their plan changed with this option will move to the
      #     new plan immediately, and be invoiced immediately.
      #   - This invoice will include any usage fees incurred in the billing period up
      #     to the change, along with any prorated recurring fees for the billing
      #     period, if applicable.
      #   - Example: The plan is billed monthly on the 1st of the month, the request is
      #     made on January 15th, so the plan will be changed on January 15th, and an
      #     invoice will be issued for the partial month, from January 1 to January 15,
      #     on the original plan.
      # - `requested_date`: changes the plan on the requested date (`change_date`).
      #   - If no timezone is provided, the customer's timezone is used. The
      #     `change_date` body parameter is required if this option is chosen.
      #   - Example: The plan is billed monthly on the 1st of the month, the request is
      #     made on January 15th, with a requested `change_date` of February 15th, so
      #     the plan will be changed on February 15th, and invoices will be issued on
      #     February 1st and February 15th.
      #
      # Note that one of `plan_id` or `external_plan_id` is required in the request body
      # for this operation.
      #
      # ## Customize your customer's subscriptions
      #
      # Prices and adjustments in a plan can be added, removed, or replaced on the
      # subscription when you schedule the plan change. This is useful when a customer
      # has prices that differ from the default prices for a specific plan.
      #
      # <Note>
      # This feature is only available for accounts that have migrated to Subscription Overrides Version 2. You can find your
      # Subscription Overrides Version at the bottom of your [Plans page](https://app.withorb.com/plans)
      # </Note>
      #
      # ### Adding Prices
      #
      # To add prices, provide a list of objects with the key `add_prices`. An object in
      # the list must specify an existing add-on price with a `price_id` or
      # `external_price_id` field, or create a new add-on price by including an object
      # with the key `price`, identical to what would be used in the request body for
      # the [create price endpoint](/api-reference/price/create-price). See the
      # [Price resource](/product-catalog/price-configuration) for the specification of
      # different price model configurations possible in this object.
      #
      # If the plan has phases, each object in the list must include a number with
      # `plan_phase_order` key to indicate which phase the price should be added to.
      #
      # An object in the list can specify an optional `start_date` and optional
      # `end_date`. If `start_date` is unspecified, the start of the phase / plan change
      # time will be used. If `end_date` is unspecified, it will finish at the end of
      # the phase / have no end time.
      #
      # An object in the list can specify an optional `minimum_amount`,
      # `maximum_amount`, or `discounts`. This will create adjustments which apply only
      # to this price.
      #
      # Additionally, an object in the list can specify an optional `reference_id`. This
      # ID can be used to reference this price when
      # [adding an adjustment](#adding-adjustments) in the same API call. However the ID
      # is _transient_ and cannot be used to refer to the price in future API calls.
      #
      # ### Removing Prices
      #
      # To remove prices, provide a list of objects with the key `remove_prices`. An
      # object in the list must specify a plan price with either a `price_id` or
      # `external_price_id` field.
      #
      # ### Replacing Prices
      #
      # To replace prices, provide a list of objects with the key `replace_prices`. An
      # object in the list must specify a plan price to replace with the
      # `replaces_price_id` key, and it must specify a price to replace it with by
      # either referencing an existing add-on price with a `price_id` or
      # `external_price_id` field, or by creating a new add-on price by including an
      # object with the key `price`, identical to what would be used in the request body
      # for the [create price endpoint](/api-reference/price/create-price). See the
      # [Price resource](/product-catalog/price-configuration) for the specification of
      # different price model configurations possible in this object.
      #
      # For fixed fees, an object in the list can supply a `fixed_price_quantity`
      # instead of a `price`, `price_id`, or `external_price_id` field. This will update
      # only the quantity for the price, similar to the
      # [Update price quantity](/api-reference/subscription/update-price-quantity)
      # endpoint.
      #
      # The replacement price will have the same phase, if applicable, and the same
      # start and end dates as the price it replaces.
      #
      # An object in the list can specify an optional `minimum_amount`,
      # `maximum_amount`, or `discounts`. This will create adjustments which apply only
      # to this price.
      #
      # Additionally, an object in the list can specify an optional `reference_id`. This
      # ID can be used to reference the replacement price when
      # [adding an adjustment](#adding-adjustments) in the same API call. However the ID
      # is _transient_ and cannot be used to refer to the price in future API calls.
      #
      # ### Adding adjustments
      #
      # To add adjustments, provide a list of objects with the key `add_adjustments`. An
      # object in the list must include an object with the key `adjustment`, identical
      # to the adjustment object in the
      # [add/edit price intervals endpoint](/api-reference/price-interval/add-or-edit-price-intervals).
      #
      # If the plan has phases, each object in the list must include a number with
      # `plan_phase_order` key to indicate which phase the adjustment should be added
      # to.
      #
      # An object in the list can specify an optional `start_date` and optional
      # `end_date`. If `start_date` is unspecified, the start of the phase / plan change
      # time will be used. If `end_date` is unspecified, it will finish at the end of
      # the phase / have no end time.
      #
      # ### Removing adjustments
      #
      # To remove adjustments, provide a list of objects with the key
      # `remove_adjustments`. An object in the list must include a key, `adjustment_id`,
      # with the ID of the adjustment to be removed.
      #
      # ### Replacing adjustments
      #
      # To replace adjustments, provide a list of objects with the key
      # `replace_adjustments`. An object in the list must specify a plan adjustment to
      # replace with the `replaces_adjustment_id` key, and it must specify an adjustment
      # to replace it with by including an object with the key `adjustment`, identical
      # to the adjustment object in the
      # [add/edit price intervals endpoint](/api-reference/price-interval/add-or-edit-price-intervals).
      #
      # The replacement adjustment will have the same phase, if applicable, and the same
      # start and end dates as the adjustment it replaces.
      #
      # ## Price overrides (DEPRECATED)
      #
      # <Note>
      # Price overrides are being phased out in favor adding/removing/replacing prices. (See
      # [Customize your customer's subscriptions](/api-reference/subscription/schedule-plan-change))
      # </Note>
      #
      # Price overrides are used to update some or all prices in a plan for the specific
      # subscription being created. This is useful when a new customer has negotiated a
      # rate that is unique to the customer.
      #
      # To override prices, provide a list of objects with the key `price_overrides`.
      # The price object in the list of overrides is expected to contain the existing
      # price id, the `model_type` and configuration. (See the
      # [Price resource](/product-catalog/price-configuration) for the specification of
      # different price model configurations.) The numerical values can be updated, but
      # the billable metric, cadence, type, and name of a price can not be overridden.
      #
      # ### Maximums, and minimums
      #
      # Price overrides are used to update some or all prices in the target plan.
      # Minimums and maximums, much like price overrides, can be useful when a new
      # customer has negotiated a new or different minimum or maximum spend cap than the
      # default for the plan. The request format for maximums and minimums is the same
      # as those in [subscription creation](create-subscription).
      #
      # ## Scheduling multiple plan changes
      #
      # When scheduling multiple plan changes with the same date, the latest plan change
      # on that day takes effect.
      #
      # ## Prorations for in-advance fees
      #
      # By default, Orb calculates the prorated difference in any fixed fees when making
      # a plan change, adjusting the customer balance as needed. For details on this
      # behavior, see
      # [Modifying subscriptions](/product-catalog/modifying-subscriptions#prorations-for-in-advance-fees).
